Hello, I wanted to practice pointer arithmetic and memory tinkering (and because I actually needed such a tool) so I extended, and rewrote a previous much basic implementation to support different size of memory blocks. There are two types of pools. One of the only allocates same sized of blocks, thus doing a bit less work, the other can provide different chunks of memory with additional best fit check and defragmentation.

I've modified my base Raspian image to do things like automatically join a predefined wireless on power up network and enable SSH. This is handy as it eliminates the need for manual configuration prior to the Pi joining the network. But I can't seem to figure out how to modify the memory split so that the GPU only gets 16MB of RAM from within the disk image itself. It used to be that there was a text file in /boot I could change to make it happen. It seems this is no longer the case.

My previous post on street trees (https://old.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/98gfsz/street_trees/) received positive feedback, so I figured I'd try a similar structure with a different topic. Today's topic is lifting weights, also known as resistance training. Below, I will lay out a variety of reasons why you should lift weights/do resistance training if you are able to. The reason I added the (probably) caveat in the title is that not everyone is able to lift weights, or to do resistan. The Moving Epidemic Method R Package.

EDIT: It looks like 'new' Reddit uses a different Markdown engine than 'old' Reddit, so you'll see a lot of carats instead of superscripts if you're using reddit.com. I'll figure out a fix later, but for now this thread works much better using the old.reddit.com page (https://old.reddit.com/r/shorthand/comments/ag2pq0/notes_on_the_reporting_style_of_orthic_shorthand/).

I have a centos7 vm that I have been using as a dev box. Today I went to boot it up and the vm window was small again (like it is before you install guest additions), even in full screen. My mouse would be finiky as well - sometimes only able to click on things in the taskbar of the KDE desktop, sometimes only on the desktop window and not the taskbar. It looked almost as if the guest additions were uninstalled, judging by the small window size, so I thought I would reinstall. During install.

Hello all, It would be nice if we understood in depth the values in the Tuning section of XMR-STAK so we can adapt our settings for each hardware setup, instead of trying random values blindly. Starting point: https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak/blob/master/doc/tuning.md For example for AMD cards, as it was observed by many people, setting mem_chunk to higher values, you get increased hash rates. I guess we need an in depth knowledge on how the Cryptonight Heavy algorithm works 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY.
