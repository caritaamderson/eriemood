                            <p>So I've had a little RC car lying around, that stopped working, so I decided to take it apart and see what made it tick. After examining the internals, I decided to pick it up as a project, and make it autonomous, with an AVR for control and a simple infrared distance sensor. It has a really small DC motor at the back, and a coil at the front. The rod, which connects the front wheels, has 2 pretty strong magnets in it, offset from the center of the coil, so depending on the polarity L9110  The ASIC device control and drive motor designtwo -channel push pull power amplifier discrete circuits integrated into a monolithic IC , peripheral devices and reduce the cost, improve the reliability of the whole. Motor control driver chip L9110 No. Symbol Function 1 OA A road output pin 2 VCC Supply Voltage 3 Supply VoltageVCC 4 B output pinOB 5 GND Ground. So, after a few years of no arduino I decided to try and get a stepper motor to do something. And ofcourse it isn't working correctly. This ( is the stepper motor that I ordered (it's weird but I wanted one with a higher holding torque). And here ( is the motor controller that I found (L9110). I'm powering it off of a 5 volt supply.
