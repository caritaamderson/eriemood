Before people on here call me a noob or refer me as a "younger wwe universe fan" Let me tell you, I have been playing wrestling games pretty much all my life. As shocking as it sounds I have played, replayed ,repurchased, wrestling games so much it might actually come across as disturbing! Well not that bad say, perhaps like every few years I might buy a used 64 with a batch of wrestling games. Through the years I had felt wrestling games have always been really well done. And I am pretty

If you want to check out my game you can see it here! https://www.facebook.com/WitchRPGGame/ PICS FOR THE GAMES ARE BEING TAKEN I ended up getting a huge lot of games from a game reviewer that, in his words, "got games in too fast to review" so he had boxes of still sealed games. While the opened games are added to my collection, I have no real interest in keeping any of the sealed stuff so.hey, lets make trades! I will also be posting this to GameSales so paypal and trade are both options. -----THE PICS!----- -----THE LIST----- -----Gameboy Advance----- Pokemon Sapphire. All games are factory sealed.every single one on this list. I got a huge lot of games, traded a few of them out, and a number of people asked for an /r/gamesale thread. I've priced them based upon averages of most recently sold, verified sealed items and not just games with a stock photo, or games that were obvious re-seals. Anything under  please add  for shipping first class. Free first class shipping up to , and free priority shipping from  up. -----THE PICS!-----. IF WE HAD A DEAL IN PLACE AND I DIDN'T HEAR BACK, YOUR GAMES WENT BACK ON THE LIST. CONTACT ME IF YOU'RE STILL INTERESTED I got a MASSIVE lot of games recently and part of it included boxes and boxes of factory sealed games. I have no desire to keep these so I'm looking to trade or sell them. The values below are sale values based on ebay sold pricing of confirmed factory seals (VGPC picks up reseals, imports, and fakes so you have to confirm each one.which took way too much time).

Prior to it's release, WCW/nWo Revenge was known as WCW/nWo Live. There is a poster advertising the N64 game under this name on Ebay ( You may see references to Live in the intro as well as signs in the crowd. THQ was going to work with YUKES on a PlayStation title Let me know any trade offers that you have or let me see your lists! I am working on a project and I need more GB, GBC, and GBA games.

TLDR: THQ and Yukes make bad WWE Games due to short development cycles and bad game design, with very little attention paid to exploits and cheating within the community I am unsure of how popular the games are outside of the people who flock to the official THQ forums, but I just want to talk about how bad the games are. To start, I am a pro wrestling fan. I know it doesn't exactly give the best of first impressions, but it's better than lying. As such, I play THQ's games, but I've become. Editing Now! I only want the list of wanted games. Any offers or other deals will be denied.

Thanks for looking. Here's what's left and I'll do my best to update as they go. All discs are sold as is. Conditions range from unusable to like new, however there are no chips, cracks or data scratches in anything. If you want me to professionally resurface let me know so I can add it to your order. Shipped via USPS First Class mail from 84123. All games are game disc only. Muti disc games are sold as the entire game (I hate that per disc crap lol). Prices are based off pricecharting.com howev. The PS3 supported 7 but the PS4 will only support 4, while the Xbox One will support 8 at once: It's disappointing to see the PS4 step back from the PS3 in this aspect, especially when the Xbox One is stepping up in this regard, even surpassing the PS3's 7-controller limit. I wonder if this is due to Sony cheaping out and only using the old Bluetooth 2.1 functionality. While not every game supported more than 4 players </p>
